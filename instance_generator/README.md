# Borrel Instance Generator

Make sure to install the required package, defined in the requirements.txt. To run the program the following command can be used:

`python .\src\main.py`

The instances will be saved in the ouputs folder under the folder name specified in the config.py file. The config.py file can be adjusted to create instances based on your specifications. Below is an overview of the options that can be changed:
